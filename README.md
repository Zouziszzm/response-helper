# Better Response Helper

The "Better Response Helper" is a utility library that simplifies and standardizes the way responses received from a backend server are processed and managed in client-side applications. In modern web development, it's crucial to have a consistent approach to parsing and handling responses to ensure a seamless user experience and efficient error management. This library provides a set of tools and best practices to achieve just that.

## Features

- Unified Response Handling: Achieve a uniform response processing workflow across your client-side codebase, ensuring a consistent user experience regardless of the data source.

- Error Management: Easily detect and handle errors in a standardized way. This library provides mechanisms to handle common error types, making it straightforward to communicate error messages to users and take appropriate actions.

- Data Transformation: Streamline the transformation of response data into usable formats, such as parsing JSON or handling different content types, without having to rewrite code for each API call.

- Status Code Interpretation: Automatically interpret HTTP status codes and define actions to be taken for different statuses, whether it's a successful response, redirection, or an error.

- Customization: Adapt the response handling process to your specific application needs while maintaining a common structure across your codebase.

## Usage/Examples

```javascript
const { ResHelper } = require("better-response-helper");

function Component() {
    // API Call 
    const response = someAPICallToGetData.....!
    
    // passing the response into ResHelper function
    const result = ResHelper(response)
}
```

 ```RESPONSE: ```
```javascript
response
    // data on success
    {
        statusCode: 100 to 511,
        message: some message here,
        success: true or false,
        data: data
    }

    // data on failed
    {
        statusCode: 100 to 511,
        message: some message here,
        success: true or false,
        description: some description why the api is failed
        data: data
    }

```
